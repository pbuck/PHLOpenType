        About </h3>
        <p class="gcontent"> PHL OpenType is a growing collective of Philadelphia based designers seizing an opportunity to design for good while showing their love for the city they live in.
          Designers have volunteered to design a typeface inspired by various neighborhoods.  <br>
          Designers reasons for choosing those areas has varied from where they live currently, to what area they are from, to areas they want to explore further.
          The typefaces themselves look to celebrate all facets of life in the specific areas and provide viable typefaces for others to use on their own projects.
          These typefaces will then become available on a “Pay What You Can” price model with proceeds going directly to the neighborhoods they are designed after.
          The goal is to get a typeface for every neighborhood and have everyone represented in this project.
          This project is constantly moving and we are still in the planning stages but if your are interested in helping in any way possible, say hello! </p>

                 <div class="info">
                 <div>Give is a typeface designed by Steve DeCusatis, an art director and designer based in Philadelphia. Steve designed the full alphabet and had it programmed by PSY-OPS into a working font. The font is a personal project that can now be used by anyone in exchange for giving back to those who need it.

  <br></br>The process was somewhat clear and simple. From what started as custom lettering, initially drawn for a “giving” themed episode of Hi-Res podcast, would later become a full typeface. Designed by Steve DeCusatis, Give is a mono-weight geometric display face—perfect for a techy editorial headline or a corporate annual title. Keeping with the name and original intention, Give is offered for a donation (in any amount you can give) through this site that will go directly to local organizations in need. Give already received some accolades and was featured in the recent AIGA Philadelphia Design Awards via a panel of national judges. Steve is proud to offer his Give font to you via PHL OpenType website and he thanks you for taking a look! <br> <br> All proceeds will be evenly distributed across all causes. </div>

I feel like I went from zero knowledge about font authoring to being fully equipped to make my own fonts
I really enjoyed the process and painstaking nature of it and definitely look forward to doing it in the future.
